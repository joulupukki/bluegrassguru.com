            Boyd is a software developer and bluegrass musician from Highland, Utah. He started piano at age five and sang in church choirs for years before catching the bluegrass bug. He's self-taught on guitar, mandolin, banjo, and bass, and easily fills instrumental gaps at local jams.

            He performs with Basin &amp; Grange, a bluegrass band that won first place at the inaugural Durango Bluegrass Meltdown band competition in 2022 using two of his original compositions. His song "Pines of Caroline" won first place in the Podunk Bluegrass Festival Songwriting Contest, and in 2021 he performed at the International Bluegrass Music Association's Songwriter Showcase. He also engineered and produced Basin &amp; Grange's debut album, <em>Walk You Down the Road</em>.

            Boyd built Bluegrass Guru because he wanted a better way to keep track of songs at jam sessions and gigs. What started as a personal tool grew into an app used by bluegrass pickers across the country. When he's not coding or picking, you can usually find him mountain biking Utah trails.
